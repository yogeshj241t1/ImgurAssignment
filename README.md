<b>Imgur Gallery App - MVVM Architecture Android Assignment</b><br><br>
This repository contains an Android application showcasing the implementation of the MVVM architecture with modern Android libraries.

<b>Project Highlights:</b><br>

<b>1) MVVM Architecture:</b> Leverages the well-established Model-View-ViewModel pattern for separation of concerns.<br>
<b>2) Kotlin:</b> Utilizes Kotlin for concise and expressive code.<br>
<b>3) Dependency Injection (Dagger):</b> Manages dependencies effectively for better testability and maintainability.<br>
<b>4) Networking (Retrofit):</b> Handles asynchronous network communication with the Imgur API.<br>
<b>5) Asynchronous Programming (Coroutines, Flow, StateFlow):</b> Employs coroutines for efficient handling of asynchronous tasks and leverages Flow and StateFlow for data stream management.<br>

<b>Project Structure:</b>

<b>data:</b> Contains classes representing data models and logic related to data access and manipulation.<br>
<b>di:</b> Houses dependency injection components and interfaces ensuring clean dependency management.<br>
<b>ui:</b> Includes view classes (Activities, Fragments, etc.) and their corresponding ViewModels, facilitating separation of UI logic and data binding.<br>
<b>utils:</b> Provides utility classes for common functionalities and helper methods.<br>

<b>APIs Used:</b><br>

<b>Imgur API:</b> Leverages the Imgur API (https://api.imgur.com/) for fetching and searching images.
